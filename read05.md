## Introduction

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” weâ€™re the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.


Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js
Introduction
This tutorial will have you deploying a Node.js app to Heroku in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how to get the most out of the Heroku platform.

The tutorial assumes that you have a free Heroku account, and that you have Node.js and npm installed locally.

set up

It's all how to deploy our websites to Heroku cloud application platform

Make it worldwide
Works fine. But it works locally. WWW is for "World Wide Web" and we will turn your local server into a world wide server. We'll use Heroku cloud application platform for this. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer. First of all, you need to create an account on developer's site and install Heroku. This is not so hard. Just follow the instructions. There is also instruction on Heroku's site that can explain you how to run your first simple web server, which returns you the "Hello, World!" string. You can try it, but I think that it will be more interesting if we build our own web server from scratch. Sounds exciting.
